## SVD

In this project, we focused on analyzing the applications of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

The repository contains code in **Python** and a report related to our work (in Polish).

This project was carried out as part of the Linear Algebra in Data Analysis course during the second semester of our studies (summer 2023/2024) at WUT.
